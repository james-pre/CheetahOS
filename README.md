# CheetahOs

Building a Dektop environment in the web browser

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

Run `npm run build` to generate the filesystem(osdrive.json). Once the filesystem is created, update the file by placing all the auto generated content within the tag {"osdrive": .................}.

***Note - npm will throw an error that it is unable to find make_http_index.js. All you have to do, is to got CheetahOs/node_modules/browserfs/dist/scripts and make a copy of make_xhrfs_index.js and rename it to  make_http_index.js

***Note Some other error might occur in browserfs as a result of missing libs.
